-- | FFI bindings for C long double
--   
--   This package provides a LongDouble type, being 80bits of x87 data
--   taking up 96bits on i386 and 128bits on x86_64. On arm it is an alias
--   for 64bit double. On aarch64 it is an alias for quadruple precision
--   _Float128. It does not provide a CLDouble type usable for FFI without
--   wrapping in Ptr, this needs to be done by the compiler. See
--   <a>https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3353</a>.
